          I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for operating systems, networking, and software development. Skilled in Python 3, C, and C++ for network programming and system-level applications, with experience in automating tasks using Bash.
          Iâ€™ve worked hands-on with machine learning and virtualization tools like VMware and QEMU (community versions), always driven by curiosity to explore the deeper layers of technology. I thrive on self-driven learning and hands-on experimentation, constantly seeking opportunities to grow and contribute through innovative solutions.
